##### Abstract: 
Markets worldwide have been so impressed with what finance can do that few have stopped to think about what finance should do. It seems America has failed to question whether financial markets have become inappropriately powerful. It is true that finance and creative accounting have increased firms’ profitability and market value, but it also seems to be true that investment in such areas has deprived the world economy of growth. Real product development is malnourished, while financial engineering has been spoiled rotten. This paper will provide an overview of how the American economy has suffered by putting its eggs in the wrong basket. The analysis will explore the shift from the real economy to artificial finance, the ways the shift contributed to the crisis of 2008, and the underlying reason for this infamous shift. This analysis will be followed by a critique of the system and of the findings themselves. 
The critique will develop assumptions from which a fresh understanding of the discipline of finance will flow. The paper will survey the basis for a proper understanding of the goal of the firm, which will then help the reader develop a proper understanding of the purpose of finance. The conclusions about the goal of finance will be derived by employing deontological ethical frameworks and Reformed theological constructs. Furthermore, the paper will conclude with a recommendation of two crucial changes in the field: that companies should beware of financialization, and educators ought to take a normative approach to finance.
